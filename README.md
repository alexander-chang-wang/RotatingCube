# RotatingCube
A program demonstrating basic textures and transformations in OpenGL. Features a cube with a rainbow texture and a transparent emoji texture. The cube can be rotated using the Up, Down, Left, Right keys, and the camera perspective can be changed with the W, A, S, D keys.

This project uses GLFW for creating an OpenGL context and handling user input. It also uses GLAD for managing function pointers, and stbi_image for loading in textures.
